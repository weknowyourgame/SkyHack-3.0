This repository contains a concise, implementation-focused summary of the analysis across three deliverables for the skyhack 3.0 hackathon. Use this README for quick understanding and reproducibility.

### Problem Statement
Analyze ORD departures to:
- Identify destinations with high operational difficulty.
- Understand drivers of difficulty (e.g., load factor, tight turnarounds, baggage/transfer complexity, special services).
- Quantify risks and delays, and recommend staffing, scheduling, and investment priorities.

Data sources used are in `Dataset/` and master features are in `team_sarthak.csv`.

### Deliverable 1: Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering (`Deliverable-1.ipynb`)
- **Scope**: Ingests raw flight, PNR, bag-level, and airport data. Cleans, joins, and derives per-flight features.
- **Key outputs**:
  - Engineered dataset `team_sarthak.csv` used by subsequent deliverables.
  - Sanity checks and EDA exports (e.g., `eda_*.png`, `eda_summary_results.csv`).
- **Why**: Establishes a consistent, analysis-ready foundation with normalized features used in scoring and downstream analysis.

### Deliverable 2: Difficulty Scoring and EDA (`Deliverable-2.ipynb`)
- **Scope**: Computes a flight-level difficulty score and category, explores distributions and relationships with delays.
- **Highlights**:
  - Difficulty score `difficulty_score_scaled` and `difficulty_category` (Easy/Medium/Difficult).
  - Exploratory figures for load factor, ground time pressure, special services, and delay correlations.
- **Key outputs**: Aggregated CSVs and plots supporting the scoring framework and its validation.

### Deliverable 3: Post-Analysis and Operational Insights (`Deliverable-3.ipynb`)
- **Scope**: Turns scores into actions. Ranks difficult destinations, finds root drivers, clusters destinations, scores flight risk, and produces staffing, schedule, and investment recommendations.
- **Methods**:
  - Destination ranking with composite score (avg difficulty, % difficult, consistency, average delay).
  - Driver identification for top difficult destinations (load, turnarounds, baggage/transfer, SSR, international).
  - KMeans clustering of destinations with PCA visualization and operational labels.
  - Flight-level risk scoring and temporal patterns (time-of-day, day-of-week) for staffing guidance.
  - Schedule optimization for chronic delay flight-number routes.
  - Investment prioritization matrix (Destinations × Flights × Delay Impact).
- **Outputs written**:
  - CSV: `top_difficult_destinations.csv`, `destination_driver_analysis.csv`, `destination_clusters.csv`, `destination_recommendations.csv`, `schedule_optimization_recommendations.csv`, `investment_priorities.csv`, `operational_impact_summary.csv`
  - PNG: `difficult_destinations_analysis.png`, `driver_patterns_analysis.png`, `cluster_analysis.png`, `risk_patterns_analysis.png`, `operational_recommendations_summary.png`
  - Log: `post_analysis.log` (executive summary)

### How to Reproduce
1) Create and activate a Python environment (Python 3.10+ recommended):
```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```
install req packages

2) Ensure data files exist:
- `Dataset/Airports_Data.csv`, `Dataset/Bag_Level_Data.csv`, `Dataset/Flight_Level_Data.csv`, `Dataset/PNR_Flight_Level_Data.csv`, `Dataset/PNR_Remark_Level_Data.csv`.
- If starting from raw data, run `Deliverable-1.ipynb` to generate `team_sarthak.csv`.
3) Run notebooks in order:
- `Deliverable-1.ipynb` → build engineered dataset.
- `Deliverable-2.ipynb` → difficulty scoring and EDA.
- `Deliverable-3.ipynb` → operational insights and outputs listed above.

### Repository Notes
- Figures (`*.png`) and CSV outputs are generated by the notebooks and included for review.

### Quick Outputs Map
- **Engineered data**: `team_sarthak.csv`
- **Scoring & EDA**: `eda_*.png`, `eda_summary_results.csv`
- **Operational insights**: CSV and PNG files listed under Deliverable 3
- **Executive summary**: `post_analysis.log`
